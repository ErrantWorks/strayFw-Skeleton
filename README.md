# strayFw

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ErrantWorks/strayFw.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ErrantWorks/strayFw)

The strayFw is a PHP framework trying to be modern without following fashion.

* Homepage : http://stray.errant-works.com
* Version : beta - 0.4-Marius

It's loosely based on Model-View-Adapter architecture.

Some intro stuff yet to be written. Now, I need to code, marketing incoming.

User guide is [somewhere](http://stray.errant-works.com/guide 'user guide') on the homepage. So... read it !

Code is free, new-BSD license. So... fork us !

## Requirements

* PHP >= 5.4
* If you're using the Locale namespace, PECL intl extension >= 1.0.0
* These included dependencies :
    * [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/ 'Twig homepage')
    * [Symfony YAML Component](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/yaml/introduction.html 'The YAML Component')
    * In development environment : [Whoops](http://filp.github.io/whoops/ 'Whoops homepage')

For installation help, [check this page](http://stray.errant-works.com/guide/installation 'user guide - installation').

## Need help ?

Read the fraktastic manual !

Or add an issue on github ! ;)

## Technical considerations

* The framework follows these standards :
    * [PSR-0](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md 'PSR-0')
    * [PSR-1](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-1-basic-coding-standard.md 'PSR-1')
    * [PSR-2](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md 'PSR-2')
    * [PSR-3](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-3-logger-interface.md 'PSR-3')
* It doesn't use Composer/Packagist but you can easily add it.
